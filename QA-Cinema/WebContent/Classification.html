	<h1>Movie Classifications</h1>

	<div>
		<h2>U Universal – Suitable for all</h2>
		<h4>A U film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and
			over, although it is impossible to predict what might upset any
			particular child. U films should be set within a positive framework
			and should offer reassuring counterbalances to any violence, threat
			or horror. If a work is particularly suitable for pre-school
			children, this will be indicated in the BBFCinsight.</h4>
	</div>


	<div>
		<h2>PG Parental Guidance</h2>
		<h4>General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young
			children A PG film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or
			older. Unaccompanied children of any age may watch, but parents are
			advised to consider whether the content may upset younger, or more
			sensitive, children</h4>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>12A/12 – Suitable for 12 years and over</h2>
		<h4>Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain
			material that is not generally suitable for children aged under 12.
			No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless
			accompanied by an adult. Adults planning to take a child under 12 to
			view a 12A film should consider whether the film is suitable for that
			child. To help them decide, we recommend that they check the
			BBFCinsight for that film in advance. No one younger than 12 may rent
			or buy a 12 rated video work.</h4>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>15 – Suitable only for 15 years and over</h2>
		<h4>No one younger than 15 may see a 15 film in a cinema. No one
			younger than 15 may rent or buy a 15 rated video work.</h4>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>18 – Suitable only for adults</h2>
		<h4> No one younger than 18 may see
			an 18 film in a cinema. No one younger than 18 may rent or buy an 18
			rated video work. Adults should be free to choose their own
			entertainment. 
		<p>
			Exceptions are most likely in the following areas: <p>
          <ol>
			<li>where the material is in breach of the criminal law, or has been
			created through the commission of a criminal offence</li>
			<li>where material
			or treatment appears to us to risk harm to individuals or, through
			their behaviour, to society. For example, the detailed portrayal of
			violent or dangerous acts, or of illegal drug use, which may cause
			harm to public health or morals. This may include portrayals of
			sadistic or sexual violence which make this violence look appealing;
			reinforce the suggestion that victims enjoy sexual violence; or which
			invite viewer complicity in sexual violence or other harmful violent
			activities</li>
			<li>where there are more explicit images of sexual activity
			in the context of a sex work (see below) or where the primary purpose
			of the images in question is sexual arousal In the case of video
			works, which may be more accessible to younger viewers, intervention
			may be more frequent than for cinema films.</li>
